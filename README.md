# Success-of-an-upcoming-movie-Project1
This project was Given by Bharat Intern in my Business Analytics internship.
For this project, you need to predict the success of an
upcoming movie so that whether or not a
company should go for buying it based on
ROI. To do this, you need to come up with
a model and use the historical data.
